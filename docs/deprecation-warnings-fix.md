# Buffer() Deprecation Warnings Fix

## Problem

During the build process, we were seeing multiple Buffer() deprecation warnings:

```
(node:24904) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.
```

## Root Cause

The warnings were coming from third-party libraries that still use the deprecated `new Buffer()` constructor:

1. **tesseract.js** (v6.0.1) - OCR library for text extraction
2. **pdf2pic** (v3.2.0) - PDF to image conversion library
3. **puppeteer** (v24.15.0) - Browser automation library

These libraries are used for:
- Text extraction from PDFs and images
- PDF processing and conversion
- Document analysis features

## Solution

Since these are third-party libraries that we cannot modify, we implemented a build-time solution to suppress these warnings:

### 1. Modified package.json build script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"--no-deprecation\" next build"
  }
}
```

### 2. Added cross-env dependency

```bash
pnpm add -D cross-env
```

### 3. Updated Next.js configuration

```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      // Exclude modules that perform file system operations at import time
      const externals = Array.isArray(config.externals) ? config.externals : [config.externals].filter(Boolean);
      config.externals = [...externals, 'pdf2pic', 'gm'];
    }
    return config;
  },
};
```

## Why This Approach?

1. **Non-intrusive**: We don't modify the third-party libraries
2. **Build-time only**: Warnings are suppressed during build, but we can still see them during development
3. **Future-proof**: When these libraries update to use modern Buffer methods, we can remove the suppression
4. **Cross-platform**: Using `cross-env` ensures the solution works on all platforms

## Verification

The build now completes successfully without the Buffer() deprecation warnings:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Notes

- Our own code already uses the modern `Buffer.from()` method
- The warnings don't affect functionality, they're just noise during build
- We monitor these libraries for updates that fix the deprecation warnings
- The `--no-deprecation` flag only suppresses warnings, not errors
